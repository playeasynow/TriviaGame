# Idea
My approach to each activity is to build something that will teach me something in return, in addition to the actual software tools. If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with a band named Beach House. Their latest visual album is incredible and was inspired by Bridget Riley's work from the "Op Art" movement. Enter idea to explore more Op Art contributors and hence the game!

Here's how it works:

- The game starts when the player chooses a character by clicking on a dog's picture. The player will fight as that dog for the rest of the game.
- The player must then defeat all of the remaining dogs. Enemy dogs will be moved to the bottom of the screen.
- The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy dog's picture.
- Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy dog is moved to the defender area.
- The player will now be able to click the attack button.
  - Whenever the player clicks attack, their dog damages the defender. The opponent will lose HP (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture.
  - The opponent dog will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's dog will lose some of their HP. These points are shown at the bottom of the player dog's picture.
- The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.
  - When the defender's HP is reduced to zero or below, the enemy dog will be removed from the defender area. The player dog can now choose a new opponent.
- The player wins the game by defeating all enemy dogs. The player loses the game if their dog's HP falls to zero or below.
- Have fun!

The game uses basic jQuery methods, so is a fun way to practice your first RPG!
